# Aethaum

[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README.md) | [English](README_en.md)

**Important**: This project is still in early development stage and currently has no available release.



A declarative framework for building interactive worlds for AI agents.

Aethaum enables you to define complex game worlds and AI interaction environments through simple TOML configurations, without writing intricate Rust code.

## üéØ Core Principles

- **Declarative Configuration**: Define ECS structures using TOML
- **Logic Separation**: Separate configuration from logic with Lua handling runtime behavior
- **Automatic Translation**: TOML configurations automatically convert to high-performance Rust code
- **Flexible Extension**: Generated Rust projects can be directly extended and customized

## üöÄ Features

- üìù **TOML-Based ECS Configuration** - Clean and readable configuration syntax
- üêç **Lua Scripting Logic** - Flexible runtime logic implementation
- ü¶Ä **Bevy ECS Integration** - Powerful ECS engine support
- üî• **Hot Reload Support** - Real-time updates during development
- üéÆ **AI-Friendly Design** - Built specifically for AI agent interactions

## üìã Configuration Details

### üåç world.toml - World Configuration

    "death.toml"
]
entity_protos = [
    "player.toml",
    "enemy.toml"
]

[build]
output_dir = "generated"

[cargo]
# Standard Cargo configuration
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è systems/*.toml - System Definitions

```toml
# Only one system can be defined per TOML file
[normal]

[update]
interval = 0.1  # Update interval in seconds

# Update condition (Lua)
condition = '''
return entity.health.value > 0
'''

# Update logic (Lua)
logic = '''
entity.health.value = entity.health.value - entity.damage.amount

'''

# Event handlers
[[event_handlers]]

```

### ‚ö° events/*.toml - Event Definitions

```toml
# Multiple events can be defined in one TOML file. The 'normal' field is metadata and doesn't participate in translation

```

### üèóÔ∏è entity_protos/*.toml - Entity Prototypes

```toml
# Multiple entity prototypes can be defined in one TOML file. The 'normal' field is metadata and doesn't participate in translation
[normal]

## üöÄ Quick Start

- Currently under development and not yet available

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

1. **Define Components** - Create TOML files in `components/` directory
2. **Create Systems** - Define system logic in `systems/` directory
3. **Design Events** - Create event structures in `events/` directory
4. **Build Prototypes** - Create entity templates in `entity_protos/` directory
5. **Configure World** - Edit `world.toml` to include all definitions
6. **Build and Run** - Use CLI tools for building and execution

## üéØ Use Cases

- ü§ñ **AI Training Environments** - Provides simple interactive worlds for AI agents
- ü§ñ **AI Role-Playing** - Enables AI characters to accumulate experiences that can be transformed into memories
- üéÆ **Prototype Development** - Rapidly build small game prototypes
- üî¨ **Simulation Experiments** - Simulate complex system behaviors
